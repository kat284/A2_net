Step 1: Install the following.

	sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev

	pip3 install pybluez

Step 2: Backup the original Bluetooth config file.

	sudo cp /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service.original

Step 3: Modify the "bluetooth.service" config file with your favorite editor.

	sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/bluetooth.service

	append "-C" or "-compat" to "ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd" so it looks like this:
		ExecStart=/usr/lib/bluetooth/bluetoothd -C

	add the following to the next line: 
		ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/sdptool add SP

	add the following to the next line: 
		ExecStartPost=/bin/chmod 666 /var/run/sdp

Step 4: Reboot the RPi.

Step 5: Use "bluetoothctl" to pair your RPis.

	On the first RPi...
		
		bluetoothctl

		discoverable on

	On the second RPi...

		bluetoothctl

		scan on

			Wait until the address of the other Raspberry Pi shows up.

		pair <BT Address of first RPi>

	On both RPis:

		paired-devices

		You should see the other RPi's address in the given list.

	Troubleshooting:

		Try it a few more times until the other RPi ends up in "paired-devices" list.

		If that doesn't work try...

			On first RPi...

				trust <BT Address of second RPi>

			On second RPi...

				trust <BT Address of first RPi>

		Repeat
